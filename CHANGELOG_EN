DEV:
    New:
        On load pairs (hash/pass) result page now show count of hashes found in projects
        OS "Unknown OS" added
        Added tasks templates (see docs)
        All objects in lists display without concrete filters

    Fixed:
        In import users list process, in menu their count is not updated
        Users without hashes display error in common list
        Wrong server set in mass domain import process
        In pairs hash/pass import process not consider hash-alg
        Critical error by max_nesting_level in pairs (hash/pass) import process (thousands)
        Already founded hashes in not found list
        Alg "md5(md5($pass)" renamed to "md5(md5($pass))"
