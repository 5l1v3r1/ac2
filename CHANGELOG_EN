New:
On load pairs (hash/pass) result page now show count of hashes found in projects

Fixed:
In import users list process, in menu their count is not updated
Users without hashes display error in common list
Wrong server set in mass domain import process
In pairs hash/pass import process not consider hash-alg
Critical error by max_nesting_level in pairs (hash/pass) import process (thousands)
Already founded hashes in not found list
